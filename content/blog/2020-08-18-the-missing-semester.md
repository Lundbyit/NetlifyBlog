I've been busy at a new job and haven't had the energy and time to do anything on my free time regarding computer and programming.

I thought about writing a compiler just for fun and to educate myself some more. But wasn't sure where to start. So I checked a really cool repo on github that basically lists free courses you can take if you want a CS-education. https://github.com/ossu/computer-science

I didn't end up doing a compiler course instead I started to look into https://missing.csail.mit.edu/ which I started today. Fun easy lectures that contains heaps of tips and tricks. I've never been a heavy terminal user, but it seemed very useful.
