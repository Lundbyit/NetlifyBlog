I just finished reading [The Phoenix Project](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509), and I found it interesting and amusing.

It is a novel about IT and DevOps.

The story conveys two concepts. The first was "The three ways," which describes the processes and practices in DevOps. The second concept is "four types of work."

## The Three ways

**The first way**

It focuses on figuring removing constraints and limit work in progress. To increase throughput in an organization, you need to find the constraint. In the book, it was a person. The theory behind it is that it doesn't matter if you improve another part of your pipeline if the constraint is not managed. Because it is the constraint that limits the throughput.

Constraints can be people, technology, or processes.

**The second way**

The second way was all about feedback. Try to get feedback fast so that you can make corrections and improvements quickly.

**The third way** 

The third way is about culture. Build a culture that understands that it is essential to practice and repeat. To take risks and learn from both successes and failures. Always strive for improvement.

 

## The four types of work

It is essential to understand that there are four types of work:

* Planned work - business projects and new features
* Internal projects - maintenance
* Changes - improvement to completed projects
* Unplanned work - support

The key takeaway from this section is to minimize unplanned work. Because it hinders all other types of work.
