I've read the phoenix project not long ago, and I thought that the book was good. The authors mentioned that they got much inspiration from 'The Goal - Goldratt', so I decided to read it.

I think The Goal was a good book as well. It is about a factory, so maybe not everything is applicable in a software environment. 

But he thinks the ultimate goal of a business is to make money, and not all work leads to making money. There should naturally be slack in a system, or else it won't be efficient.

Three metrics that will indicate if a business is doing well: Net profit, return on investment, and cash flow. These should increase all the time.

Something that is mentioned in the phoenix project as well is that you have to optimize the whole system, not just a local process, if you want a higher throughput.

There is always a bottleneck in every process. You need to manage the process based on the bottleneck. To increase throughput, you will need to improve the performance of the bottleneck.

The process:

1. Identify the system's bottlenecks
2. Decide how to exploit those bottlenecks
3. Subordinate every decision to 'step two decisions'
4. Elevate the systems bottlenecks
5. If, in a previous step, a bottleneck has been broken, go back to step 1.
