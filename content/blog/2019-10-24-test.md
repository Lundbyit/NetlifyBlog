If you connect to remotes through SSH, it is possible to transfer data securely without entering your credentials. However, this isn't possible with Http protocols.

The default is to prompt the user for their username and password, which means that you need to provide your credentials every time you are pushing or pulling. That could be tiring.

If you're using windows you can type:

```
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```

There are other alternatives, but this is what I use
